## ABSTRACT

Stochastic modeling has become an essential tool for studying biochemical reaction
networks. There is a growing need for user-friendly and feature-complete software
for model design and simulation. To satisfy this need, we present GillesPy2, an
open-source Python 3 library for building and simulating mathematical and biochemical models. GillesPy2 offers an intuitive interface for robust and reproducible
model creation, facilitating rapid and iterative development. In addition to expediting the model creation process, GillesPy2 offers efficient algorithms to simulate
stochastic, deterministic, and hybrid stochastic-deterministic models. GillesPy2, an
major improvement from the original GillesPy package, is now a stand-alone Python
